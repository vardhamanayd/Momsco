	<p>Hi,</p>
	<p>The Moms Co. for us has been a journey 3 years in the making.</p>
	<p>During our first pregnancy in London, we got introduced to safe, natural, toxin tree products for ourselves and our first daughter, Myraah. When we were expecting Syna, our second daughter, we struggled to find similar products in India that we could trust. </p>
	<p>We ended up depending on trips abroad or visiting relatives from &lsquo;foreign&rsquo; countries to stock up on products that were safe. It was neither feasible nor practical. After 2 years of the struggle and seeing many moms go through something similar, we decided to start The Moms Co. We were clear that our products would have to be something that we could use ourselves, confidently and fearlessly. </p>
	<p>At The Moms Co. our products are made with love and without compromise. We have brought in experts from across the world to help us create the safest natural formulations that are certified toxin free. With Mother Nature making her presence felt very strongly, everything we create retains the good and rejects the bad to give you a product that is as pure as mother&rsquo;s love.</p>
	<p>We would like to welcome you to the family.</p>
	<p>With love and warmth,<br />Malika and Mohit.</p>
