<h2>Why did you choose the name "The Moms Co."?</h2>
<p>When trying to think of a name for our company, we wanted a name which reflects our core values and our mission. A mission to help moms make safe, natural, toxin-free product choices for themselves and their family. The Moms Co. became an obvious choice because we wanted you as a mom to be at the heart and soul of everything we do and every decision we make here. We aim to be the benchmark for:</p>
<p>1.<i>Honesty</i>. We offer what we promise. No hiding in the fine print. We accept no leeways of any kind when it comes to you and your babies.</p>
<p>2. <i>Keep It Simple</i>. It&rsquo;s quite tempting to talk in non-human scientific jargons and cheesy brandlines. Yet we refrain. You deserve full transparency so you can make the best decision for yourself and your baby.</p>
<p>3. <i>Experts Advice</i>. We unwaveringly work with only the best in class doctors, researchers and experts in their respective field. No compromises.</p>
<p>4. <i>Safety Comes First</i>. We referenced the highest global safety standards as our starting point. Our experts have since then continually helped us raise the bar further by considering leading scientific evidence to improvise our products &amp; processes. We are certified 100% Toxin-Free and Made Safe by <a href="www.safecosmeticsaustralia.com.au/certification">Safe Cosmetic Australia's Toxic-Free Campaign.</a></p>
<p>5. <i>Details Matter, A LOT</i>. Everything we do - we have a snarky obsession to detail whether it be formulation, product, packaging or design. For when you deserve the best, why settle for less?</p>
